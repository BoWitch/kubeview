# KubeView
Kubernetes cluster visualiser and mapper

Shows what is happening inside a Kubernetes cluster in terms of objects and how they are interconnected. Data is fetched real-time from the Kubernetes API. The status of some objects (Pods, ReplicaSets) are colour coded red/green to represent their status and health

Currently displays:
- Deployments
- ReplicaSets / StatefulSets / DaemonSets
- Pods
- Services
- Ingresses
- LoadBalancer IPs
- PersistentVolumeClaims

**Note.** This is VERY work in progress! â˜¢

## Application Components
- **Client SPA** - Written in Vue.js. All visualisation, mapping & logic done here
- **API Server** - Scrapes Kubernetes API and presents it back out as a custom REST API. Also acts as HTTP server to the SPA
