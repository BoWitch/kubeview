# KubeView
Kubernetes visualiser prototype thing

â˜¢ This is VERY work in progress!

Shows what is happening inside a Kubernetes cluster. Currently displays:
- ReplicaSets
- Pods
- Services
- Ingresses
- Public IPs

## Components
- **Client SPA**, written in Vue.js. All visualisation, mapping & logic done here
- **Server**, scrapes Kubernetes API and presents it back out as a custom REST API. Also will act as server to the SPA
